# MeowlWatch
MeowlWatch (pronounced "meal-watch") makes it easy for students at Northwestern University to check their meal balances. Simply sign in with your NetID to see your remaining meals.

A widget is also available as an in-app purchase which you can add to your device's notification center. The widget refreshes automatically, giving you ultimate convenience when you need to check your balance.

NOTE: While the developer, Jonathan Chan, is a student at Northwestern, he is unaffiliated with the Northwestern administration and Northwestern Dining. This app was developed independently of Northwestern, and its content does not necessarily reflect the views of Northwestern University. Although the developer will make the best effort to ensure that the app functions as expected, he has no control over the web servers and cannot guarantee 100% uptime.
